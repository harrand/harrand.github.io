If you&rsquo;re looking for programming related topics, you probably wanna skip this one, although it is pretty funny.</p><h2 id=context>Context<a href=#context class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been playing around with ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI. I&rsquo;ve mainly brought up programming related topics, aswell as writing prompts - It can provide very creative responses!</p><p>However, I have to make this post because I started experimenting with humour with ChatGPT. Specifically, puns.</p><p>There is a maxmoefoe video from 10 years ago, titled: <a href=https://youtu.be/Oj3xjah_W9Y>Pokémon 7-11 - Prank call - Poképuns</a>. Here, maxmoefoe continually trolls a 7-11 worker with poképuns. The video is funny, although I cant help but feel bad for the worker.</p><p>I wanted to recreate a similar dialogue with ChatGPT. By doing that, we get more glorious puns, but without harassing a poor retail worker. I only included my initial prompt to ChatGPT, although the paragraphs replied were put together with prompts from me, so the ideas can&rsquo;t be fully credited to ChatGPT, although the puns can.</p><h2 id=the-irate-man-and-the-employee>The Irate Man and the Employee<a href=#the-irate-man-and-the-employee class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><blockquote><p>Harrand: Can you write a dialogue where an irate man is complaining to a store employee that they did not have any of a certain product in stock. The employee should respond as normal to attempt to resolve the situation, however the employee constantly attempts to make pokemon-puns during the phonecall, causing the customer to become more and more irate.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ChatGPT: Certainly! Here is a dialogue between an irate customer and a store employee who attempts to make Pokemon-puns during the conversation:</p></blockquote><p>Customer: (irately) Hello, I was in your store earlier today and I couldn&rsquo;t find any of the XYZ brand paper towels. Can you tell me why you don&rsquo;t have any in stock?</p><p>Employee: (cheerfully) Hello sir! Sorry for the inconvenience. Let me check our inventory for you. (pausing) Hmm, it looks like we&rsquo;re all out of XYZ brand paper towels. We must have been caught in a &ldquo;Pikachu-nado&rdquo;!</p><p>Customer: (irately) This is not a joke, I needed those paper towels for a very important task.</p><p>Employee: (still cheerfully) I&rsquo;m sorry sir, I didn&rsquo;t mean to &ldquo;Jolteon&rdquo; your nerves. Let me see if I can find another option for you. (pausing) Ah, we do have some ABC brand paper towels in stock. They&rsquo;re not exactly the same as XYZ, but they should get the job done.</p><p>Customer: (frustrated) I specifically asked for XYZ brand. I don&rsquo;t want any substitutes.</p><p>Employee: (trying to remain cheerful) I understand your frustration, sir. But sometimes we have to &ldquo;Growlithe&rdquo; up and make do with what we have. ABC brand is a high-quality product, I&rsquo;m sure it will work just as well for you.</p><p>Customer: (irately) I don&rsquo;t want ABC brand, I want XYZ brand. This is ridiculous. How hard is it to keep a basic household item in stock?</p><p>Employee: (still trying to be cheerful) I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. We&rsquo;ll do our best to restock XYZ brand as soon as possible. In the meantime, perhaps you can &ldquo;Charmander&rdquo; your expectations and give ABC brand a try?</p><p>Customer: (fuming) I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re still making these stupid Pokemon puns. I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;ll just go to a different store.</p><p>Employee: (realizing they have upset the customer) I&rsquo;m sorry sir, I didn&rsquo;t mean to &ldquo;Squirtle&rdquo; your mood. I hope you have a better experience at the other store. Please do not hesitate to call us again if you need any assistance in the future.</p><p><em>a few hours pass&mldr;</em></p><p>Employee: (answering the phone) Thank you for calling XYZ Store, this is [Employee] speaking. How may I &ldquo;Chikorita&rdquo; you today?</p><p>Customer: (irately) Yes, I called earlier today to complain about the lack of XYZ brand paper towels in your store. I was told you would restock, but when I went back today, you still didn&rsquo;t have any. This is unacceptable.</p><p>Employee: (apologetically) I&rsquo;m sorry for the inconvenience, sir. Let me check our inventory again to see what&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pidgey&rdquo; on. (pausing) Hmm, it looks like our supplier is experiencing a delay in their shipment. We&rsquo;re working on getting more XYZ brand paper towels as soon as possible, but it might be a few more days before we have them in stock.</p><p>Customer: (frustrated) This is ridiculous. How can you run a store without basic household items like paper towels?</p><p>Employee: (trying to be reassuring) I understand your frustration, sir. We apologize for the inconvenience and we&rsquo;re doing our best to get more XYZ brand paper towels in stock as soon as possible. In the meantime, perhaps you could try using a &ldquo;Rayquaza&rdquo; to clean up your messes? Or if you&rsquo;re feeling &ldquo;Snorlax&rdquo;-y, you could just take a break and come back later when we have them in stock.</p><p>Customer: (irately) I don&rsquo;t want to use a rake, I want paper towels. This is ridiculous. I&rsquo;m going to take my business elsewhere.</p><p>Employee: (apologetically) I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way, sir. We apologize for the inconvenience and we hope you&rsquo;ll give us another chance in the future. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to call us if you have any other questions or &ldquo;Charmander&rdquo;-ies.
The irate customer slams the phone down on the receiver and turns to his wife, who is sitting nearby on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you believe the ridiculous ordeal I just went through?&rdquo; he exclaims. &ldquo;This employee at XYZ Store kept making these stupid Pokemon puns and wouldn&rsquo;t take my complaint seriously. It was like talking to a child.&rdquo;</p><p>His wife looks equally stunned by the oddness of the situation. &ldquo;That does sound pretty bizarre,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe they were still making Pokemon puns after you were so clearly upset. Did they even apologize for not having the paper towels in stock?&rdquo;</p><p>The irate customer sighs and runs a hand through his hair. &ldquo;Yes, they apologized, but it was like they were just trying to placate me with these childish jokes. I can&rsquo;t believe I have to deal with this. I&rsquo;m going to report them to their manager and take my business elsewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>As he rants, his wife starts to chuckle. &ldquo;Well, at least they were trying to make a &lsquo;Pikachu&rsquo; out of a bad situation,&rdquo; she says with a grin.</p><p>The irate customer&rsquo;s face contorts in frustration. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you start with the Pokemon puns too,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I swear, this is the worst day ever. I curse the gods for my misfortune.&rdquo;</p><p>His wife tries to suppress her laughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t resist,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But come on, it&rsquo;s not that bad. It&rsquo;s just a delay in getting some paper towels. We can use something else in the meantime. Maybe we can use a &lsquo;Charmander&rsquo; to dry the dishes?&rdquo;</p><p>The irate customer groans and throws up his hands. &ldquo;I give up. I&rsquo;m surrounded by Pokemon puns on all sides. I&rsquo;m going to go take a walk and clear my head.&rdquo;
The irate customer takes a deep breath and steps outside for a walk, hoping to clear his head. As he crosses the street, he does a double take when he sees something strange on the sidewalk. It looks like&mldr; a Charmander?</p><p>He rubs his eyes and looks again, convinced that he must be losing his sense of reality. But no, there it is - a small, orange lizard-like Pokemon with a flaming tail. It looks just like the ones he used to collect as a kid.</p><p>The irate customer approaches the Charmander tentatively, wondering if he&rsquo;s hallucinating. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but&mldr; am I going insane? Is this really happening?&rdquo;</p><p>The Charmander looks up at him and blinks its big, round eyes. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Charizard&rsquo; question,&rdquo; it says in a high-pitched voice. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m real enough, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking.&rdquo;</p><p>The irate customer&rsquo;s jaw drops. &ldquo;I&mldr; I can&rsquo;t believe this,&rdquo; he stammers. &ldquo;This is insane. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>The Charmander gives a little shrug. &ldquo;Just taking a walk, like you,&rdquo; it says. &ldquo;But I think it&rsquo;s time for me to &lsquo;Charmander&rsquo; off&rdquo;</p><p>The irate customer replies: &ldquo;It was nice meeting you!&rdquo;</p><p>Charmander says: &ldquo;Thanks, &lsquo;Mewtwo&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p><p>With that, the Charmander disappears in a puff of smoke, leaving the irate customer standing on the sidewalk with his mouth open in shock.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
