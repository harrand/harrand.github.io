### Comparison of some occlusion culling algorithms used in modern game engine development (2019)

Research project consisting of CPU-centric occlusion-culling approaches using Topaz, aswell as a writeup dissertation.

Compares a software-renderered occlusion culling approach against an older approach based on potentially-visible sets of nodes. Both are implemented in separate forks of Topaz 1.0. This was a dissertation for university.

Regrettably, the paper does not touch upon GPU-based approaches, which have become more popular now.

Maze Darwinism (2018)
\
Language: Java

Maze Darwinism was an application which displayed a maze which would be solved automatically. The solution would evolve via natural selection until the maze was solved.

The natural selection was implemented in pure Java, and the graphics done in javax.swing.
