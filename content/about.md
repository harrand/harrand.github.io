- Harrand is my pseudonym, but I also go by Harry. You can call me whichever you prefer
- I am a game engine programmer, in and outside of industry.
	- Currently I work on the Cobra engine at Frontier Developments.
	- Outside of work, I work on the Topaz engine by myself.
- You can find my CV [here](../CV.pdf)
- You'll find my videos and livestreams on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/theharryh666), although note that I have no upload/streaming schedule and the content that I provide is not always programming related.
