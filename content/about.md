- Harrand is my pseudonym, but my real name is Harry.
- I am a game engine programmer, in and outside of industry.
	- Currently I work full-time on the [Cobra](https://www.frontier.co.uk/about/cobra-development-technology-tools) engine at Frontier Developments.
	- In my free-time, I'm working on three projects - my compiler, [psyc](https://github.com/harrand/psyc), my game engine, [Topaz](https://github.com/harrand/Topaz), and a 2D game using that engine, [Red Nightmare](https://github.com/harrand/Red-Nightmare)
	- Feel free to look through the Projects section above to see my older work.
- You can find my CV/resume [here](../CV.pdf).
- You'll find my videos and livestreams on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/theharryh666), although note that I have no upload/streaming schedule and the content that I provide is not always programming related.
