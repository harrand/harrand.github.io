Disclaimer: This is not programming related. If you're looking for programming related topics, you probably wanna skip this one, although it is pretty funny.

## Context
Recently I've been playing around with ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI. I've mainly brought up programming related topics, aswell as writing prompts - It can provide very creative responses!

However, I have to make this post because I started experimenting with humour with ChatGPT. Specifically, puns.

There is a maxmoefoe video from 10 years ago, titled: [Pokémon 7-11 - Prank call - Poképuns](https://youtu.be/Oj3xjah_W9Y). Here, maxmoefoe continually trolls a 7-11 worker with poképuns. The video is funny, although I cant help but feel bad for the worker.

I wanted to recreate a similar dialogue with ChatGPT. By doing that, we get more glorious puns, but without harassing a poor retail worker. I only included my initial prompt to ChatGPT, although the paragraphs replied were put together with prompts from me, so the ideas can't be fully credited to ChatGPT, although the puns can.

## The Irate Man and the Employee
> Harrand: Can you write a dialogue where an irate man is complaining to a store employee that they did not have any of a certain product in stock. The employee should respond as normal to attempt to resolve the situation, however the employee constantly attempts to make pokemon-puns during the phonecall, causing the customer to become more and more irate.

> ChatGPT: Certainly! Here is a dialogue between an irate customer and a store employee who attempts to make Pokemon-puns during the conversation: 

Customer: (irately) Hello, I was in your store earlier today and I couldn't find any of the XYZ brand paper towels. Can you tell me why you don't have any in stock?

Employee: (cheerfully) Hello sir! Sorry for the inconvenience. Let me check our inventory for you. (pausing) Hmm, it looks like we're all out of XYZ brand paper towels. We must have been caught in a "Pikachu-nado"!

Customer: (irately) This is not a joke, I needed those paper towels for a very important task.

Employee: (still cheerfully) I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to "Jolteon" your nerves. Let me see if I can find another option for you. (pausing) Ah, we do have some ABC brand paper towels in stock. They're not exactly the same as XYZ, but they should get the job done.

Customer: (frustrated) I specifically asked for XYZ brand. I don't want any substitutes.

Employee: (trying to remain cheerful) I understand your frustration, sir. But sometimes we have to "Growlithe" up and make do with what we have. ABC brand is a high-quality product, I'm sure it will work just as well for you.

Customer: (irately) I don't want ABC brand, I want XYZ brand. This is ridiculous. How hard is it to keep a basic household item in stock?

Employee: (still trying to be cheerful) I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. We'll do our best to restock XYZ brand as soon as possible. In the meantime, perhaps you can "Charmander" your expectations and give ABC brand a try?

Customer: (fuming) I can't believe you're still making these stupid Pokemon puns. I'm done. I'll just go to a different store.

Employee: (realizing they have upset the customer) I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to "Squirtle" your mood. I hope you have a better experience at the other store. Please do not hesitate to call us again if you need any assistance in the future.

*a few hours pass...*

Employee: (answering the phone) Thank you for calling XYZ Store, this is [Employee] speaking. How may I "Chikorita" you today?

Customer: (irately) Yes, I called earlier today to complain about the lack of XYZ brand paper towels in your store. I was told you would restock, but when I went back today, you still didn't have any. This is unacceptable.

Employee: (apologetically) I'm sorry for the inconvenience, sir. Let me check our inventory again to see what's "Pidgey" on. (pausing) Hmm, it looks like our supplier is experiencing a delay in their shipment. We're working on getting more XYZ brand paper towels as soon as possible, but it might be a few more days before we have them in stock.

Customer: (frustrated) This is ridiculous. How can you run a store without basic household items like paper towels?

Employee: (trying to be reassuring) I understand your frustration, sir. We apologize for the inconvenience and we're doing our best to get more XYZ brand paper towels in stock as soon as possible. In the meantime, perhaps you could try using a "Rayquaza" to clean up your messes? Or if you're feeling "Snorlax"-y, you could just take a break and come back later when we have them in stock.

Customer: (irately) I don't want to use a rake, I want paper towels. This is ridiculous. I'm going to take my business elsewhere.

Employee: (apologetically) I'm sorry you feel that way, sir. We apologize for the inconvenience and we hope you'll give us another chance in the future. Please don't hesitate to call us if you have any other questions or "Charmander"-ies.

The irate customer slams the phone down on the receiver and turns to his wife, who is sitting nearby on the couch.

"Can you believe the ridiculous ordeal I just went through?" he exclaims. "This employee at XYZ Store kept making these stupid Pokemon puns and wouldn't take my complaint seriously. It was like talking to a child."

His wife looks equally stunned by the oddness of the situation. "That does sound pretty bizarre," she says. "I can't believe they were still making Pokemon puns after you were so clearly upset. Did they even apologize for not having the paper towels in stock?"

The irate customer sighs and runs a hand through his hair. "Yes, they apologized, but it was like they were just trying to placate me with these childish jokes. I can't believe I have to deal with this. I'm going to report them to their manager and take my business elsewhere."

As he rants, his wife starts to chuckle. "Well, at least they were trying to make a 'Pikachu' out of a bad situation," she says with a grin.

The irate customer's face contorts in frustration. "Don't you start with the Pokemon puns too," he says. "I swear, this is the worst day ever. I curse the gods for my misfortune."

His wife tries to suppress her laughter. "I'm sorry, I couldn't resist," she says. "But come on, it's not that bad. It's just a delay in getting some paper towels. We can use something else in the meantime. Maybe we can use a 'Charmander' to dry the dishes?"

The irate customer groans and throws up his hands. "I give up. I'm surrounded by Pokemon puns on all sides. I'm going to go take a walk and clear my head."

The irate customer takes a deep breath and steps outside for a walk, hoping to clear his head. As he crosses the street, he does a double take when he sees something strange on the sidewalk. It looks like... a Charmander?

He rubs his eyes and looks again, convinced that he must be losing his sense of reality. But no, there it is - a small, orange lizard-like Pokemon with a flaming tail. It looks just like the ones he used to collect as a kid.

The irate customer approaches the Charmander tentatively, wondering if he's hallucinating. "Excuse me," he says, "but... am I going insane? Is this really happening?"

The Charmander looks up at him and blinks its big, round eyes. "Well, that's a 'Charizard' question," it says in a high-pitched voice. "But I'm real enough, if that's what you're asking."

The irate customer's jaw drops. "I... I can't believe this," he stammers. "This is insane. What are you doing here?"

The Charmander gives a little shrug. "Just taking a walk, like you," it says. "But I think it's time for me to 'Charmander' off"

The irate customer replies: "It was nice meeting you!"

Charmander says: "Thanks, 'Mewtwo'!"

With that, the Charmander disappears in a puff of smoke, leaving the irate customer standing on the sidewalk with his mouth open in shock.
